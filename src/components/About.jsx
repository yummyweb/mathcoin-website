            <h1>DO THE $MATH</h1>
            <p>Memetoshi Mathamoto has grown weary watching endless amounts of degens disregard the vision of decentralization, thinking that memecoins will give them generational wealth. These days have passed. Wit the roll out of $MATH, degens are able to learn and unlock the powers of memetic wealth.</p>
            <p>$MATH is here to make memecoins and degen math fun again. Launched with no pre-sales, zero taxes, liquidity locked on Raydium and our contract slow burning, $MATH is a coin for degens, by degens. There is no intrinsic value other than what you accredit to it. Do the $MATH, be a chad.</p>
